            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has captured the hearts of food lovers worldwide. This comforting
                casserole is made with layers of tender pasta sheets, rich and flavorful meat or vegetable sauce, creamy
                ricotta or béchamel, and a generous topping of melted cheese. Its versatility allows for endless variations,
                from traditional beef and tomato-based recipes to vegetarian options featuring spinach, mushrooms, or even
                zucchini as a pasta substitute. The key to a perfect lasagna lies in the balance of flavors and textures,
                creating a dish that’s hearty, satisfying, and irresistibly delicious.</p>
            <p>Whether served at a family gathering, a holiday feast, or a cozy dinner at home, lasagna is the ultimate
                crowd-pleaser. The slow-cooked sauce, layered with perfectly cooked pasta and creamy fillings, creates a
                symphony of flavors that only improves when baked to golden perfection. This dish pairs wonderfully with a
                crisp green salad, garlic bread, and a glass of red wine, making it a complete and indulgent meal. Easy to
                prepare in advance, lasagna is also ideal for meal prep, as it reheats beautifully and tastes even better
                the next day. Perfect for celebrations or everyday dining, lasagna is a timeless comfort food that brings
                people together around the table.</p>
