# Recipes Website Project

## Introduction
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course and focuses on building a simple recipes website using only HTML. The goal is to create a main page (`index.html`) that links to multiple individual recipe pages, each featuring a recipe with a title, image, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will demonstrate:
- Proficiency in structuring a website using semantic HTML elements.
- The ability to create and link multiple pages within a project.
- Effective use of elements like headings, lists, links, and images to display content.
- An understanding of how to organize files and folders for a web development project.

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex websites in the future.
